**Top plot**: Shows the pupil diameter over time, derived from the video. Clicking on points in this plot will update other plots and images to display data corresponding to the selected time frame.

**Bottom plot**: Displays the response time series for the selected ROI.

**Left video**: This video captures the pupil of the mouse's eye. Use the range slider to adjust brightness and contrast or use the arrows to step through frames. The "Movie" tab allows you to watch the video as a continuous playback.

**Right video**: Two-photon imaging video, which records calcium activity in the primary auditory cortex. There is one cell that is active during the stimulus, and we'll point that out in future iterations of the interface.

This following image segmentation corresponds to the two-photon video and identifies 37 regions of interest (ROIs).
