**-- Work in progress --**

[Dandiset 001256](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001256/0.241120.2150) contains data for analyses presented in Cody et al. (2024): _Cortical Zinc Signaling Is Necessary for Changes in Mouse Pupil Diameter That Are Evoked by Background Sounds with Different Contrasts_ (https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0939-23.2024). This document (work in progress) is an interactive view of the data for this study.

Right now, this document shows session [sub-AA0304_ses-20210311T192013](https://neurosift.app/?p=/nwb&url=https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/ff8b39ad-ff59-4043-9bd1-9fec403cb51b/download/&dandisetId=001256&dandisetVersion=0.241120.2150), but in the future, you will be able to select from the 30 sessions in this dataset. The session contains a number of acquisitions.

This following video captures the pupil of the mouse's eye. Use the range slider to adjust brightness and contrast or use the arrows to step through frames. The "Movie" tab allows you to watch the video as a continuous playback. _In the future, the stimulus will be shown._

This following is a plot showing the pupil diameter over time, derived from the video. Clicking on points in this plot will update other plots and images to display data corresponding to the selected time frame. _In the future, the stimulus will be shown._

This section shows the two-photon imaging video, which records calcium activity in the primary auditory cortex. There is one cell that is active during the stimulus, and we'll point that out in future iterations. _In the future, the stimulus will be shown._

This floowing plot displays the response time series for a collection ROIs. As mentioned above, one ROI is relevant to the stimulus, and we'll point that out in future iterations. _In the future, the stimulus will be shown._

This image segmentation corresponds to the two-photon video and identifies 37 regions of interest (ROIs).
