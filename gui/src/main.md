# Dandiset 001256

Here we describe what this Dandiset is all about.

---

Here we describe that we are looking at a particular acquisition for a particular [subject/session](https://neurosift.app/?p=/nwb&url=https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/ff8b39ad-ff59-4043-9bd1-9fec403cb51b/download/&dandisetId=001256&dandisetVersion=0.241120.2150).

---

Here we explain that this is the video of the mouse eye. You can use range slider to control the brightness/contrast and the arrows to advance through the frames. You can also click on the Movie tab to watch the video.

<div class="pupil-video"></div>

---

Explain that this is a plot of the pupil diameter over time. (Does it agree with the video?)

You can click on points in the plot and all the other plots and images will update to show the corresponding data.

<div class="pupil-radius-timeseries-plot"></div>

---

Explain that this is the two photon video. In the future we'll remove the unnecessary controls.

<div class="two-photon-video"></div>

---

Explain that this is the image segmentation of the two photon video (does this match? does it need to be aligned somehow?). There are 37 regions of interest (ROIs). In the future, we'll want to be able to somehow identify the IDs of the ROIs.

<div class="image-segmentation"></div>

---

Explain that this is the ROI response series. (Does this match the video and the segmentation?) In the future we'll want to be identify the IDs of the ROIs.

<div class="roi-timeseries-plot"></div>

---

Do we want to then focus on a particular ROI and show things in a single plot? What exactly are we expecting to see?
